# moneytracker
This is a simple flutter Android APP to track your incomes and expenses.
At the moment, the APP is divided in two pages:
  - ✔️ Overview: Where you can see your total balance, total incomes, total expenses and every single transaction you have added.
  - ✔️ Add Transaction: By clicking on the (+) button in the Overview page, you can add your transactions specifying if it is an income or an expense, the amount and a description.

I'll keep developing the APP to add more advanced features such as:

  - 🔜  Creating the APP icon and name.
  - 🔜  The option to edit or delete transactions.
  - 🔜  Adding dates to the transactions so you can see your incomes/expenses by date (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly and total).
  - 🔜  Allow the user to create categories to classify each transaction.
  - 🔜  Implementing graphs to have a visual view of how your money is distributed.
  - 🔜  A sing in page where you can register or sing in with your google account.
  - 🔜  Improving the APP design.
  - 🔜  Export to Excel feature.
  - 🔜  Launching on PlayStore.
I hope you liked it 😊
