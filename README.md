This is a simple flutter Android APP to track your incomes and expenses.
At the moment, the APP is divided in two pages:
  - ✔️ Home Screen: Where you can see your total balance, incomes, expenses and every transaction you added.
  - ✔️ Add Transaction Screen: By clicking on the (+) button in the Home Screen, you can add your transactions specifying:
    
    - Expense or Income.
    - Amount.
    - 🔜  Account.
    - 🔜  Category.
    - Date.
    - Description.

I'll keep developing the APP to add more advanced features such as:

  - 🔜  Creating the APP icon and name.
  - ✔️  The option to edit or delete transactions by clicking on them.
  - ✔️  Adding dates to the transactions so you can see your incomes/expenses by date (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly and total).
  - 🔜  Lateral menu to navigate to different pages (Home Screen, Accounts, Categories, etc). 
  - 🔜  Categories Page: Allows the user to create different categories to classify each transaction.
  - 🔜  Accounts Page: Allows the user to create different accounts to allocate their transactions.
  - 🔜  Implementing graphs to have a visual view of how the money is distributed.
  - 🔜  A sing in page where you can register or sing in with your google account.
  - 🔜  Improving the APP design.
  - 🔜  Export all the tranactions to an Excel file.
    
I hope you liked it 😊
